    <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical 
    models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task or set of 
    tasks through experience, without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is a type of artificial
    intelligence that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each scenario. Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to fraud detection and predictive analytics.</p>

    <h2>Data Source: ml_data.csv</h2>
    <h2>Value: 'high_q'</h2>
    <p>Description: The ‘high_q’ value was set based on 
    the top 69% quality of life index ratings.  If a city was in the category, 
    ‘high_q’ was scored with a 1.</p>
    <h2>Features: ’max_temp’, ‘humidity’, ‘cloudiness’, ‘wind_speed’, ‘2017’, 
        ‘2018’, ‘2019’, ‘2020’, ‘2021’, ‘purchase_power’, ‘safety’, ‘health_care’, 
        ‘cost_of_living’, ‘prop_to_income_ratio’, ‘traffic_comm_time’, ‘pollution’, 
        ‘climate’</h2>

    <p>Description:  The features listed as years each represent the amount of 
    total government expenditures, by state, on total outdoor activities including 
    travel and tourism.</p>
