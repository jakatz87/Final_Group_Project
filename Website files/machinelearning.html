<section class="MLdescription">
    <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical 
    models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task or set of 
    tasks through experience, without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is a type of artificial
    intelligence that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each scenario. Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to fraud detection and predictive analytics.</p>

    <h2>Data Source: ml_data.csv</h2>
    <h2>Value: 'high_q'</h2>
    <p>Description: The ‘high_q’ value was set based on 
    the top 69% quality of life index ratings.  If a city was in the category, 
    ‘high_q’ was scored with a 1.</p>
    <h2>Features: ’max_temp’, ‘humidity’, ‘cloudiness’, ‘wind_speed’, ‘2017’, 
        ‘2018’, ‘2019’, ‘2020’, ‘2021’, ‘purchase_power’, ‘safety’, ‘health_care’, 
        ‘cost_of_living’, ‘prop_to_income_ratio’, ‘traffic_comm_time’, ‘pollution’, 
        ‘climate’</h2>

    <p>Description:  The features listed as years each represent the amount of 
    total government expenditures, by state, on total outdoor activities including 
    travel and tourism.</p>

    <p>The Random Forest model produced 100% accuracy on every attempt.  
    After the first attempt of running the model, several features were 
    added to the ‘drop’ list. Regardless of the features kept for the model, 
    or the number of n_estimators, Random Forest produced 100% accuracy for 
    this data set.</p>

    <p>The Logistic Regression Model produced a 98% accuracy score keeping the original set of features.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>What are the issues with the Logistic Regression Model?</h2>
    <p>The data file used for the model was merged from four different 
    sets of data, each with differing values and amounts of data.  
    The issue was how the Quality of Life Index was transferred.  
    The original file with this data represented only 60 cities in 
    the US.  When the data was merged with the 2000 city file, the 
    Quality of Life Index was merged on “state” to ensure that most 
    of the 2000 cities had that data point.  In the merged file, any 
    city in the same state would have the same Quality of Line Index score.</p>


    <h2>What is the takeaway for the Logistic Regression Model?</h2>
    <p>The strength of the Random Forest Model is not the 100% accuracy,
    it is the ability to measure `feature_importances_`</p>

      <p>This represents the 2nd set of measured Feature Importances.  
        In the first set, the features of “2012” through “2016” were kept.  
        The feature ‘2014’, representing the government expenditures of outdoor 
        activities, by state, was the top feature in the Random Forest Model, 
        with ‘health_care’ as 2nd.  When limiting the features to the past five 
        years of data for government expenditures by date, ‘safety’ became
         the number one feature. As investors consider locations for property, 
        safety, health care, climate, and government expenditures on outdoor activities would be factors that require serious consideration.
