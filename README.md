# Final_Group_Project
## First Segment Project Deliverable
A serial AirBnb investor is looking to make a decision on where to invest. Using weather data, occupancy data, and other factors, the team at Final CountGroup Consulting was brought onboard to conduct research and provide analysis to the investor and their board of directors.
Questions posited thus far:
 * What areas are ideal to invest in hospitality properties based on historic and predicted weather trends?
 * What other factors might affect profitability in this sector?
 * What are the top vacation rental markets based on occupancy rates and weather patterns, and how do they compare to each other?
 * How does the seasonality of vacation rental demand in different markets correspond to the weather patterns, and what is the best time to invest in each market?
 * What is the impact of weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding on vacation rental markets, and how can investors mitigate risks?
 * How do pricing strategies for vacation rentals vary based on weather patterns, and what are the best pricing strategies for different weather conditions?
 * What is the historical performance of vacation rental markets in terms of occupancy rates, rental income, and return on investment, and how does weather data impact these metrics?
